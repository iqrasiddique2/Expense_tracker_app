The application fully implements all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing expenses. Users can easily add new expenses by entering the amount, selecting a category, and providing the date and an optional note. All saved expenses are displayed in a dynamic table that reads data directly from the SQLite database using JOIN queries to show meaningful category names. Any existing record can be updated by simply selecting it from the table, which automatically fills the form for editing. Users can then modify the details and save the changes back to the database. Additionally, unwanted entries can be deleted instantly by selecting them and clicking the delete button. These seamless CRUD operations ensure smooth and efficient expense management within the app.
